            <p>
              In JavaScript, each function gets its own scope. Scope is
              basically a collection of variables as well as the rules for how
              those variables are accessed by name. Only code inside that
              function can access that function's scoped variables. A variable
              name has to be unique within the same scope. A scope can be nested
              inside another scope. If one scope is nested inside another, code
              inside the innermost scope can access variables from either scope.

              Sass or Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets is a CSS preprocessor
              that adds power and elegance to the basic language. It allows you
              to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more,
              all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large
              stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and
              running quickly. A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that
              extends CSS by allowing developers to write code in one language
              and then compile it into CSS.

              jQuery - is a library used for DOM Manipulations - Has nothing to
              do with models - don't have two-way binding feature - becomes
              complex and difficult to maintain when size of project increases -
              Sometimes you have to write more code to achieve the same
              functionality as in Angular

              modular - Maintainable, when project size increases - is Fast and

              More than testing your knowledge of UI/UX designers, this question
              is a way for the employer to better evaluate your experience as a
              front-end developer. There's no one answer to this question except
              that UI/UX design verges more on the human side of the design
              process. This question is an opportunity for you to draw on past
              experience and show your employer where your coding skills will
              take you in your future role.

              The front end means what appears in front of the users (yes, the
              websites). So, a front-end developer implements the structure,
              design, behavior, and animations related to every bit and piece
              you see whenever you open a website or a mobile application.

            <p>
              Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and
              other React features without writing a class. With Hooks, you can
              extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested
              independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic
              without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to
              share Hooks among many components or with the community.

              Replication is the process of synchronizing data across multiple
              servers.
              <br />
              Replication provides redundancy and increases data availability.
              With multiple copies of data on different database servers,
              replication provides a level of fault tolerance against the loss
              of a single database server.

              1.No Buffering – Node.js applications never buffer any data. They
              simply output the data in chunks.<br />
              2.Asynchronous event driven IO helps concurrent request handling –
              All APIs of Node.js are asynchronous. This feature means that if a
              Node receives a request for some Input/Output operation, it will
              execute that operation in the background and continue with the
              processing of other requests. Thus it will not wait for the
              response from the previous requests.<br />
              3.Fast in Code execution – Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript Runtime
              engine, the one which is used by Google Chrome. Node has a wrapper
              over the JavaScript engine which makes the runtime engine much
              faster and hence processing of requests within Node.js also become
              faster.<br />

              All APIs of Node.js library are aynchronous that is non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for a API to return data. Server moves to next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps server to get response from the previous API call.

              Interoperability: Web services are accessible over network and
              runs on HTTP/SOAP protocol and uses XML/JSON to transport data,
              hence it can be developed in any programming language. Web service
              can be written in java programming and client can be PHP and vice
              versa. Reusability: One web service can be used by many client
              applications at the same time. Loose Coupling: Web services client
              code is totally independent with server code, so we have achieved
              loose coupling in our application. Easy to deploy and integrate,
              just like web applications. Multiple service versions can be
              running at same time.
